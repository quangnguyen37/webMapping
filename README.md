# Web mapping with python

Using folium to create a interactive map. Mapping countries population and volcanoes.

## Description

The program written in Python uses the Folium library to create an interactive web map that displays population and volcano data. The program reads in two data sets: one containing information about volcanoes in a text (.txt) file, and the other containing population data in a JSON file.

The two maps are then combined into a single web map that allows users to explore both the population and volcano data simultaneously. Users can zoom in and out on the map, and click on individual markers or regions to see more detailed information about the data.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* python 3.10, folium
